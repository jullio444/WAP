            <h1>State Management Quiz</h1>    

            <h2>1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems? </h2>

    Yes a post request can be bookmarked but since a bookmark only consists of the URL, 
    all of the form parameters will be lost. This will often mean that the web server 
    doesn't know what to do with the request, since it was expecting some form parameters.

    <h2>2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</h2>

    The request dispatching provides the facility of forwarding the request to another resource 
    it may be html, servlet or jsp. This is essential in inclusion of the content of 
    another resource as well. It is one of the way of servlet collaboration.

    <h2>3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch? </h2>

    Redirect sends a HTTP Header to the response object to tell the user to access any resource 
    (including resources from other servers). That changes the actual URL of the Request and 
    requires an additional round trip. This doesn't happen in a request dispatch which just 
    forward the request and response objects to another internal servlet, without changing the request URL.

    <h2> 4. What is an attribute ? </h2>

    An attribute in servlet is an object that can be set, get or removed from one of the following scopes:

    -request scope
    -session scope
    -application scope

    <h2>5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters? </h2>

    The servlet programmer can pass informations from one servlet to another using attributes. 
    It is just like passing object from one class to another so that we can reuse the same 
    object again and again.

    Parameters may come into our application from the client request, or may be configured 
    through deployment descriptor (web.xml) elements or their corresponding annotations. 
    When you submit a form, form values are sent as request parameters to a web application. 
    In case of a GET request, these parameters are exposed in the URL as name value pairs 
    and in case of POST, parameters are sent within the body of the request. 

    <h2>6. What are dangers of using attributes? </h2>

    It can be dangerous to use application attributes because it is global and is seen by all the 
    request and servlets of the application. They are also not thread safe (except request attributes).

    <h2> 7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</h2>

    HTTP is stateless in a sense that after a web server responds to a request, there's no memory
    the server does not retain session information or a status about each communicating partner for multiple requests.
    Example of stateful protocol: FTP and Telnet

    <h2>8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method). </h2>
    
    -URL Rewriting
    -Cookies
    -Hidden Form Fields (from Get and Post)
    -Viewstate
    -HttpSession 
    -Local Persistence 

    <h2>9. How long does a session last? </h2>

    By default, a session lasts until there's 30 minutes of inactivity, but you can adjust
    this limit so a session lasts from a few seconds to several hours in the web.xml file or 
    using setMaxInactiveInterval method of the session.

    <h2>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last? </h2>

    Session cookies disappear once the user closes the browser window. 
    All permanent cookies have an expiration date written in their code. 

    <h2>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting? </h2>

   If your browser does not support cookies, URL rewriting provides you with another session 
   tracking alternative. URL rewriting is a method in which the requested URL is modified to 
   include a session ID. Advantage of URL rewriting is that it doesn’t depend upon cookies and 
   will work whether cookies are enabled or disabled.

   <h2>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo? </h2>

    It is because the attribute was lost when you click the button to send the form. 
    It was only set when you loaded the Servlet as the GET method, which doesn't happens when you send the form (you are using POST method instead).
