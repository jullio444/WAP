            <h2>1. What is the difference between a web server and a web container?</h2>

            Web Server: It provides HTTP Request and HTTP response. 
            It handles request from client only through HTTP protocol. 
            It contains Web Container. Web Application mostly deployed on web Server.

            Web containers are responsible to provide the run time environment to web applications. 
            It contains components that provide naming context and manages the life cycle of a web 
            application. Web containers are a part of a web server and they generally processes 
            the user request and send a static response.

            <h2>2. What is a servlet?</h2>

            A servlet is a Java class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that
            host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. 
            Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to 
            extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet 
            technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.

            <h2>3. How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</h2>

            A client makes an HTTP request to the Web server via a Web browser.
            The Web server receives the request and delegates the request to the web (servlet) container. 
            The web container checks the properties of the HTTP request to determine which servlet to be
            called for the request. If the servlet has not been initialized before, the web container will
            create an instance of the servlet and call its init() method to initialize it and then constructs 
            a request object to pass to the servlet. (The request includes, among other things:
            -Any HTTP headers from the client
            -Parameters and values passed from the client (for example, names and values of query strings in the URL)
            -The complete URI of the servlet request
            The container creates a thread for this servlet request.
            The container constructs a response object for the servlet. The container then invokes the servlet service() method. 
            The service method dispatches requests to the servlet doGet() or doPost() methods, 
            depending on the HTTP header in the request (GET or POST) and passes the results to the response object.
            The response object hands over the response information to the container.
            The container forwards this to the web server which puts it in the http packet and sends it
            to the browser. The browser picks it up and displays the response on the screen.
            In case of infrequent situations such as server shutdown, the web container calls the destroy() 
            method of the servlet to discard it, when appropriate, so that it can be garbage collected.



            <h2>4. Who creates request objects?</h2>

            The web container creates request objects.

            <h2>5. What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</h2>

            There are three states of a servlet: new, ready and end. 
            The servlet is in new state if servlet instance is created. 
            After invoking the init() method, Servlet comes in the ready state. 
            In the ready state, servlet performs all the tasks by invoking the service() method. 
            When the web container invokes the destroy() method, it shifts to the end state.

            <h2>6. Who calls init and when?</h2>

            The web container calls init to initialize the servlet if no object was created before.

            <h2>7. Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</h2>

            doGet should be overriden to suit client response. init() method may be overriden in scenarios where 
            there is initialization code connecting to the database. service() method should not be overriden.

            <h2>8. In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</h2>

            By default web-server creates only one instance per servlet, if multiple request 
            is going to a servlet then each request will be processed in a separate thread, 
            so container creates a thread per request for the single servlet instance, thus 
            making the servlet multi-threaded.

            <h2>9. What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?</h2>

            Servlet instance variables are not thread safe in a sense that if a given variable is modified
            by Thread-A and expects not to be changed on the next request, Thread-B may make changes to the 
            same variable and also expect the same.
